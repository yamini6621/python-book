    "\n",
    "All control flow statements are compound statements that contain multiple statements. A distinguish feature of Python is its use of indentation levels (leading spaces or tabs) to define the boundary of a compound statement. Most languages use indentation and specific delimiters such as parentheses `()` or curly bracket `{}`. Though it is possible to use one or more spaces/tabs as an indentation level, the suggested standard is 4 space character. Please stay with this suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compound statement has one or more *clauses*. A clause consits of a *header* and a *suite*. A header starts with a special keyword such as `if`  or `for` and ends with a colon `:`. The clause headers of a compound statement are all at the same indentation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "A header is followed by a group of statements that belong to the same clause. The group of statements is called a *code block* or a *code suite*. All statements of a suite have the same level of indentation that is one level deeper than its clause header."

    "Python uses **Boolean expressions** to represent conditions/tests used in compound statement clause headers. Boolean expressions are named after George Boole, an English mathematician who invented a logic system to compute true and false in the 1800s. A Boolean expression uses four types of operators: \n",
    "\n",
    "- relational operators: compare two values to test a condition, evaluated to a boolean value of `True` or `False`.\n",
    "- membership operators: `in` and `not in` are used to find if a value is a member of a sequence.\n",
    "- identity operators: `is` and `is not` are used to check if *two variables* refer to the same object.\n",
    "- logical operators: `not`, `and`, and `or` are used to create a complex Boolean expression that consists of multiple subexpression/conditions. `and` and `or` operators support short circuiting."

One or multiple statements below it, are grouped together and is called a `code block` or a `code suite`. *All statments in a code block have the same level of indentation*, i.e., they have the same number of leading spaces. Python style guide suggests using 4-space characters to indent a code block from its `if clause`. Forget tabs. \n",
