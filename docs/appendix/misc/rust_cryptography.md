# Rust and Cryptography

The recommended path to learn Rust and Web3 development is as following. You can learn them in parallel but learn materials inside each section sequentially.

- Read the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Check out the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- [Programming Rust 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1492052590)
- [Crust of Rust Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa): the series has many insights about how Rust libs are implemented.
