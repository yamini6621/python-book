# Python Crash Course

This is a crash course of Python that shows the essential computation constructs in Python. Most other programming languages also have these basic constructs. This section gives you a basic idea of what programs look like. Don't worry if it raises more questions (it should), more details will be covered in the following sections.

## 1 Hello World

It is a tradition from C programming language to say "Hello World!" as the first program in learning a new programming language.

In Python, it is a single line:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Without any programming experience, you can guess that it prints the "Hello World!" message, though not to a printer but to a computer console. In the above code, `print` is a function. A function, like a computer, process its input and performs some tasks. A function name followed by a pair of parentheses is a function call â€“ the computer runs/executes the function. The string `"Hello World!"` is the input to the print function.
A string is written inside a pair of single or double quotes. Therefore, a pair of single quotes also works: `print('Hello World!')`.

Compare the Python code to a Java Version of "Hello World!":

```java
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Almost everything except `println("Hello World")` is a distraction.

The `print("Hello World!")`
