#  Rust, Crypto and Flutter

The recommended path to learn Rust and Web3 development is as following. You can learn them in parallel but learn materials inside each section sequentially.

## Rust

- Read the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Check out the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- [Crust of Rust Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa): the series has many insights about how Rust libs are implemented.
- [Programming Rust 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1492052590)
- [Tokio Tutorial](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial)


## Crypto

- Take [Online Cryptography Course](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/OnlineCrypto/)
- Read online book [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook). The code is written in Python. Please try to understand every program there.
- Do the same to [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook).

## Front End

To learn Flutter (my preference) or React Native. You can find a good resource from [10 Best Flutter Courses for Beginners to Learn in 2022](https://medium.com/javarevisited/my-favorite-flutter-and-dart-programming-courses-for-beginners-9e8355710d78).

The instructor of [https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) is a good teacher whom I learned a lot from.
