# Learn Web3 Development

The recommended path to learn Web3 development is to learn Rust and Crypto is as following. You can learn two section in parallel but learn materials inside each section sequentially.

## Rust

- Read the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Check out the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- Read the book [Programming Rust 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1492052590)

## Crypto

- Take [Online Cryptography Course](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/OnlineCrypto/)
- Read online book [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook). The code is written in Python. Please try to understand every program there.
- Do the same to [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook).

## Front End

To learn Flutter (my preference) or React Native. You can find a good resource from [10 Best Flutter Courses for Beginners to Learn in 2022](https://medium.com/javarevisited/my-favorite-flutter-and-dart-programming-courses-for-beginners-9e8355710d78).

The instructor of [https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) is a good teacher whom I learned a lot from.
