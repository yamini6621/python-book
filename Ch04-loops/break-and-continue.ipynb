    "In the code block of a `for` or `while` loop, sometimes you want to skip the processing for certain data. For example, when you divide a number by every element in a list, you want to skip the `0` as a divisor because it crashes the program.  You use the `continue` statement to continue to the next iteration of the loop. The following flow chart describes the continue control flow:\n",
