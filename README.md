# Pragmatic Python Programming

This is an introductory Python programming book for knowledge workers. Unlike most existing Python programming books, it teaches Python programming in a pragmatic way. Here the word "pragmatic" means practical and professional. Knowledge workers learn Python programming to solve real world problems. The book teaches essential programming concepts and skills to effectively write correct, easy-to maintain, and reliable production-grade code. Specifically, in addition to the basic Python programming concepts in Part I, it covers the following topics that are important for any professional developer:

- best programming practices such as good naming, good design, code documentation, same level abstraction, small functions, separation of concerns, and continues refactoring.
- type hints.
- test driven development.
- application tracing.
- Python performance issues and tradeoffs.
