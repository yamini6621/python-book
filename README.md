# Pragmatic Python Programming

This is an introduction book to Python programming. Unlike most existing Python programming books, it teaches Python programming in a pragmatic way. Here the word "pragmatic" means practical and professional. People learn Python programming to solve real world problems effectively. The book teaches practical programming concepts and skills to write correct and easy-to maintain programs in the most productive way. Specifically, in addition to the basic Python programming concepts, it covers the following topics that are critical to write professional code:

- best programming practices such as good naming, good design, code documentation, same level abstraction, small functions, separation of concerns, and continues refactoring.
- test driven development.
- application tracing.
- type hints.
- Python performance issues and tradeoffs.
