Instead of writing a long list of statements of a complex application, you can divide the application into a set of subtasks such that each task is relatively easy to be solved.\n",

    "Another huge benefit is that a function name summarizes the task. It is easy to understand the two function calls by their names if you don't care about the implementation details.You can image the pain when you have to figure out the purpose of 1,000 lines of code.\n",

    "- Python suggests snake_casing as function name: lower case words separated by an underscore.\n",

    "### 2.2 Function Parameters and Default Argument\n",
    "\n",
    "A function header may have zero, one, or more `parameters` enclosed in parentheses. If there is no parameter, the function header just has a pair of parentheses. If there are two or more parameters, they are separated by a comma `,`. In the above function headers, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `function_name1()`\n",
    "- `function_name2(parameter1, parameter2)`\n",
    "- `function_name3(parameter1, parameter2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have as many parameters as you want, but it is not a good idea to have more than five parameters. You way want to split your function into small functions or compose parameters when there are too many parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the naming of variables and functions, you should give meaningful names to the function parameters because they are used as variables in the function code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a function, you pass values to the parameters. These values are called `arguments`. Python supports `default argument`. You can define a default value for a parameter as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, prefix = 'Hello')\n",
    "    print(prefix, name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `greet` without giving an argument for `prefix`, it uses the `'Hello'` as the argument value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use parameter names when you call a function with some arguments, these are called `keyword arguments`. It let you specify arguments in any order. For example, you can call `gree(prefix='hi', name='alic')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports arbitrary arguments using syntax like `*args` and `**kwargs`. For example, `print` function uses `*args` to take a number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Doc string for Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for trivial functions, you should write a _doc string_ for the function. It can be a single line doc string, as shown in the first examples, or it can be a multi-line doc string: a summary line, followed by a blank line and detail description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Function Body\n",
    "\n",
    "The function body is the code block indented (4 spaces, per Python coding style) below the function header. The statements in the function body are just regular statements. You can use all control statements (`if`, `for`, and `while`) in the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "An non-indented statement below the function header marks the end of the function body. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, prefix = 'Hello')\n",
    "    print(prefix, name)\n",
    "print('Done')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the statement `print('Done')` is not part of the function. You should use a blank line separate a function and the statements before and after it.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, prefix = 'Hello')\n",
    "    print(prefix, name)\n",

    "print('Done')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 The `pass` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "When you design a program, you divide your application into several functions but don't know the implementation details for some of you functions. You can use the `pass` keyword as a temporary function body to write a **function stub** -- you can also print a message or return some value in the stub. You replace it with real code when you are ready to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def do_homework():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Returning Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions perform operations without returning a value, they are called `void functions`. The `void` means **nothing**. The above function that prints a message is a void function. The function `exit()` takes no argument and is a void function. It exits the program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many functions perform some computation and return a value as its result. These are `value-returning` functions. You use the `return expression` in a function to return a value and complete the function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(number1, number2):\n",
    "    return number1 + number2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A function body may have multiple `return` statements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def isOdd(number):\n",
    "    if number % 2 == 1:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "\n",
    "    # unreachable statement\n",
    "    print('unreachable')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(isOdd(5))\n",
    "print(isOdd(8))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever Python executes a `return` statement, it **completes** the current function and returns its expression value. In the above code, the `print('unreachable')` is unreachable because both branches of the `if` statement has a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the above code is not a good example because `number % 2 == 1` is a boolean expression and can be returned directly. The above code can be simplified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def isOdd(number):\n",
    "    return number % 2 == 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(isOdd(5))\n",
    "print(isOdd(8))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.7 Returning Multiple Values\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to return multiple values using the `return` statement. You list the variables to be returned after the `reture` keyword and use `,` to separate the multiple values. The following is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_name():\n",
    "    first = input('First name? ')\n",
    "    second = input('Second name? ')\n",
    "    return first, second\n",
    "\n",
    "first_name, second_name = get_name()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(first_name, second_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, you use multiple variables, separated by `,` to retrieve the multiple returning values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement `return first, second` actually returns a data type of `tuple`. Python uses the syntax `(e1, e2, e3,...)` to represent a tuple that have multiple elements. The `return first, second` can be written as `return (first, seond)`. We will cover tuple in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Calling Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a function is to `call` a function. To call a parameterless function, use the syntax `function_name()`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sayHi():\n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",
    "\n",
    "# call the function\n",
    "sayHi()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a function that has parameters, you need to pass an argument for each parameter in the parentheses, in the same order as they are defined. These arguments are called `positional arguments`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(first_name, last_name):\n",
    "    print(f'Hi {first_name} {last_name}')\n",
    "\n",
    "greet('Alicia', 'Keys')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the parameter name to pass an argument to the function call. This is a so-called `keyword argument`. You don't need to follow the order as defined in the function header. For example, you can call the above functions as one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `greet(first_name='Alicia', last_name='Keys')`\n",
    "- `greet(last_name='Keys', first_name='Alicia')`\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword argument is helpful when there are several parameters and you want make them more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function has a default argument, you can use the default argument or pass a new value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(first_name, last_name, prefix='Hello'):\n",
    "    print(f'{prefix} {first_name} {last_name}')\n",
    "\n",
    "greet('Alicia', 'Keys')\n",
    "greet('Bob', 'Dylan', 'Hi')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The default arguments must be at the end of the parameter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a keyword argument, it must be after positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(first_name, last_name, prefix='Hello'):\n",
    "    print(f'{prefix} {first_name} {last_name}')\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(prefix='Hi', first_name='Elton', last_name='John')\n",
    "greet('Alicia', prefix='Hi', last_name='Keys')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional arguments cannot follow keyword arguments, they must be passed before keyword arguments. A function call `greet('Alicia', prefix='Hi', 'Keys')` causes a an error: `SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 Functions Are Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is an object that has a type (class `function`), an identity (the function name) and a value (the definition of the function). As an object, it can be assigned to another variable or can be passed as an argument in function call. A function takes another function as its parameter is called a **high-order function**. The name is fancy but the concept is rather simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of higher-order function. Python's `map` function takes a function as its first parameter and a list as the 2nd parameter. The result is a `map` object that can be converted into a list using `list(m)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def double(num):\n",
    "    return num * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "items = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "list(map(double, items))\n",

    "# this also works\n",
    "d = double\n",
    "list(map(d, items))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful that you use `double`, not `double()` in `map`. `double()` is a function call -- it is invalid because it misses its argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 Methods are Function-like Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "When you bind a function with a specific data type, it becomes a method. It helps organize functions into a group of operations that are closely related to a data type. Method is an object-oriented programming concept that will be covered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, it is enough to know an important difference between a method and a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You call a function using a function name followed by arguments in a pair of parentheses `f(arg1, arg2)`\n",
    "- You call a method using a dot notation like `data.f(arg1, arg2)` because the function is bind with some data `a`. Conceptually, you can think `data.f(arg1, arg2)` as `f(data, arg1, arg2)` -- the `data` is always the first argument.\n"

    "\n",
    "The scope for variables defined in control statements `if`, `for` and `while` is its enclosing function. If they are not defined in a function (very rare), they are in the global scope. Below is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    for number in range(3):\n",
    "        print(number)\n",

    "    print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `number` is created in the `for` loop but its scope is the `main` function. Therefore it can be used by the `print(number)` statement in the `main` function.\n",

    "## 3 Call Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually your program has a entry point function and the function calls other functions which call more other functions. When a function calls another function, Python interpreter saves the status of the current function in a data structure called a `call frame`, then executed the callee function. Similarly, the callee function may call another function and more and more, eventually, we have a so-called call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "![call stack](images/call-stack.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can debug the following program to check its call stack and call frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def foo():\n",
    "  x = \"foo\"\n",
    "  print(f\"foo line 2. x is {x}\")\n",
    "  print(\"foo line 3\")\n",
    "  print(\"foo line 4\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def fum():\n",
    "  print(\"fum line 1\")\n",
    "  print(\"fum line 2\")\n",
    "  print(\"fum line 3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def bar():\n",
    "  x = 21\n",
    "  print(f\"bar line 2. x is {x}\")\n",
    "  fum()\n",
    "  foo()\n",
    "  print(f\"bar line 5. x is {x}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "  x = 42\n",
    "  bar()\n",
    "  print(f\"main line 3. x is {x}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` function calls the `bar` function that calls three more functions: `print`, `fum`, `foo`. The `print` function is called twice. When the `bar` calls `foo`, there are three functions in the stack: at the bottom, `main`, then `bar`, then, at the top, `foo`. You can debug the code to see the call stack. When a function returns, its call frame is popped up from the stack and its caller becomes the top function in the call stack. The variable `x` is a local variable in its function scope and may have different values at different time.\n"
