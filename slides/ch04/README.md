# Repetition Structures

Loop is what makes a program so powerful (Turing complete).

- [While Loop](while-loop.ipynb): the while loop and `infinite` loop.
- [For Loop](for-loop.ipynb): sequence of data times and `for` loop.
- [Continue and Break](break-and-continue.ipynb): the `continue` and `break` statement.
