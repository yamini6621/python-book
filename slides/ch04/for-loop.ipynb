    "The variable used in the `for` clause is called a `target variable` because it is assigned the value of each element in the sequence in each loop iteration. It is important to give it a meaningful variable name.\n",

Conceptually it is rather simple, just treat the nested loop as a regular statement and everything becomes clear. Following is an example.
